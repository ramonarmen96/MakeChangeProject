## Make Change Project

### Description

The Make Change Project is meant to act as a cash register and gives commands
on exactly how much change the customer is supposed to receive and what bills
the customer should be receiving. Starting from largest to smallest it is
designed to give the customer the least amount of bills/coins as possible.

### Topics and Technologies used

* while loops
* if and else if statements


### How to run

Run the application in terminal

### Lesson learned

* (Problem) when making change I had the while loop run only if change was GREATER than the
  amount that needed to be subtracted and this resulted in showing zero tens due.

* (Solution)I fixed it by making it great than or equal to.

* I was going to have a counter for every bill and coin, but i just reset the
counter to zero after every while statement.
